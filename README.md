# Even/Odd Number Checker (Python)

## Description
This is a simple Python program that checks whether a number is **even** or **odd**.  
It uses a **function** and a **while loop** to allow the user to check multiple numbers continuously until they choose to quit.

---

## How It Works
1. The program defines a function `check_even_odd(num)`:
    - Returns `"Even"` if the number is divisible by 2.
    - Returns `"Odd"` otherwise.
2. The program uses a **while loop** to take input repeatedly:
    - User enters a number.
    - Function checks the number.
    - Result is displayed.
    - Enter `0` to quit the program.
